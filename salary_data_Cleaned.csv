Citizen is a free app that keeps you and your loved ones safe. It is a powerful force for good that has already evacuated people from burning buildings, diverted school buses from nearby terrorist attacks and reunited missing children with their parents.

Using our unique technology, 911 alerts are made available to the public and are accompanied by live stories, real-time updates, and user-generated content to provide you with the information you need to protect yourself and your loved ones. We act fast, break news, and give people the immediate information they need to stay safe. And we're just getting started.

This year Citizen will expand further across the United States with the express mission of making your world a safer place. We're looking for hardworking, mission-driven individuals to help take the Citizen app to the next level as we scale up nationwide. With a group of passionate builders from Facebook, Square, Uber, Google and HQ Trivia, Citizen is the company your current company doesn't want you to know about.

Citizen is backed by Sequoia Capital, 8VC, and Founders Fund and has raised tens of millions in VC funding.

Our Challenges
Scaling: We have one of the fastest-growing organic user bases in NYC, and have expanded to multiple other cities. We are focused on the nationwide launch and the need to support that scale. A Citizen international launch will follow.
Bursting: We designed our infrastructure to scale without notice in case of a spontaneous incident where we need to inform our entire user base. On significant events, we see over a million simultaneously connected clients and their associated live streams. The core systems need to be able to efficiently support these traffic patterns and continue to scale to millions of more users in the future.
Machine learning: We process thousands of hours of audio every day looking for incidents that impact our users' safety. To do this at scale, we've built ML models for audio analysis and targeting using the current state of the art from academia.
Analytics: We want to alert users to the incidents that matter to them, in a way that scales across different geographic densities and demographics.
Mobile video streaming: Our app will ingest high-quality video at low-latency, transcode, and redistribute the video to external media outlets seamlessly.
Radio hardware: We build our own software-defined radio-based devices to consume all radio dispatch in every major city, whether analog or digital.

Our Stack - languages and technologies we use and teach
Mobile: Swift (iOS), Kotlin (Android)
Web: React.js, TypeScript
Services: Go for transactional systems; Python for analytical systems
Datastores: Cassandra, MySQL, Redis, Google PubSub
Infrastructure: Kubernetes on Google Cloud

Role Description
While we launched on iOS first, we've found we have a significant, fast-growing base of Android users that in many neighborhoods has already surpassed iOS. The Senior Android Engineer will drive our mobile product execution for the Android platform in concert with the iOS engineers.
We view Android as a core offering, not as a follow-on to iOS. We want to be able to launch and experiment with new features in both.
Work with Product and Design to define and iterate on product scope and features.
Collaborate with iOS, Backend, and Data Science to build and launch new features, as well as re-architect and maintain existing features.
Collaborate across Engineering with designs, code reviews, and whiteboard sessions. We strive to eliminate errors and wasted cycles developing code.
Demonstrate rigor with code quality, best practices, and code review, while understanding product tradeoffs.

Preferred Qualifications
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or related field
5 years experience as a developer building applications for Android
Proficient in Java/Kotlin with strong object-oriented development

Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction requires our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.

In an uncertain real estate market, lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they're used to in terms of speed and value in title and escrow.

Our streamlined algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company in early 2019 to go from startup to #8 in the country. With a broader nationwide footprint and a huge data set for machine learning, we are poised to transform this industry. We will repurpose the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

We're hiring a hands-on Senior Manager to lead our underwriting team


We're seeking an outstanding Senior Manager of data science (or decision science) to take the lead on improving and expanding our core, patented, industry-shaking underwriting systems. The ideal candidate is someone who is excited about dividing their time as follows: code development/review (40%), strategic and customer-facing planning with the executive team (30%), and management of a small team of data scientist individual contributors (30%). Read our blog post on our full-stack data scientist philosophy and how small, high velocity teams have delivered for us. You will be freed of bureaucracy and ""managing managers""; you will be both a people leader, and in the weeds; accountable for extending existing stable predictive models, as well as launching new ones, in 2020.

As a data science leader at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at PayPal, Oracle, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors, including regulators.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that has been in production since 2018, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

Do you have what it takes?
More than 5 years of relevant experience in data science:
Fintech: you've built credit risk, fraud, or insurance models or algorithms and worked with engineering teams to deploy them
Academia: you've used real-world data to publish highly cited peer-reviewed journal articles on prediction or inference using open source tools
Series A and Series B start-up environments: you've served a catch-all analytics role doing everything from data cleaning to SQL joins to building predictive models
Strengths aligned with our needs
Can you inspire confidence in non-DS stakeholders and regulators?
Does your team look forward to coming in to work to collaborate with you every day?
Can you explain how to build a random forest without making reference to code?
When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
Does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
We'd like to help you do the best work of your life

Over the past decade, Success Academies has grown faster than any charter network in the nation, building a vibrant network of 47 elementary, middle and high schools. Our ~16,000 children mostly poor and minority are out-performing students at top city and suburban schools across New York State. Our goals for our second decade are even more ambitious: to grow to 100 schools and to educate 50,000 children across New York City in a uniquely holistic pre-k-12 system, bringing transformational change here and across the country. At 100 schools, we will graduate 3,000 scholars each year who are prepared to enter, persist and graduate from college and eventually to lead in business, government and civic realms.
